# Universitary project in the first year of Master at Universit√© Cote d'Azur

The goal was to implement some machine learning models that could do classification on tweets, to detect potentially hateful ones.
This is done using a dataset extracted from https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language

## USAGE

From the root repository <br>
```bash
python ./src/main.py [options]
Options:
-v: verbose
-t: training | Trains the models on the data prepared by train_test_splitting.py
-e: embedding | Embeds the tweets using word embeddings, NOT WORKING
-i: interactive | Allows the user to enter tweets and get predictions
Example: python main.py -v -i
```

The models are trained on bag of words.<br>
By default, we do not use oversampling however you can decide to switch it on by setting the OVERSAMPLING variable in train_test_splitting.py to True.
